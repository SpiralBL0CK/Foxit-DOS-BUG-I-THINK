# Foxit-DOS-BUG-I-THINK
STACK OVERFLOW IN FOXIT Version:  9.0.1.1049

During my jit spray researcher i stumbled upon this usless bug..<img width="522" alt="abc" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25670930/213843840-40ead7f0-9c81-4340-92a3-c60eb0ac0534.PNG">

It's uless as it will only trigger in debugger and if you run the pdf outside foxit won't crash. Enjoy!
