# Foxit-DOS-BUG-I-THINK
STACK OVERFLOW IN FOXIT Version:  9.0.1.1049

During my jit spray researcher i stumbled upon this usless bug..<img width="522" alt="abc" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25670930/213843840-40ead7f0-9c81-4340-92a3-c60eb0ac0534.PNG">

It's uless as it will only trigger in debugger and if you run the pdf outside foxit won't crash. Enjoy!
ps if you run the provided pdf close it(like close the pdf) and than close foxit you will see this idk if exploitabl or nah don't rlly care :))

Ps. if you think this is not a bug please dm me on twitter why and i will take this down asap and write an apologies tweet. thx
